# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage to help learn some of the basics of HTML, Git, CSS, and Java to help me prepare for the rest of the work in the UO Coding Bootcamp, and to work as a hub for notes related to these coding languages. During this project I learned the basics of webdesign and how to progress from a general foundation to a functional website. Doing this, I was able to work a bit with HTML to lay out a foundation, CSS to design the look of my website, and Java to add functionality.

## Usage

This webpage functions as study guide for myself or anyone learning HTML, Git, CSS, and Java. The webpage is divided into different sections that focus on each of these languages, and if you open the DevTools you can see that JavaScript is running and will give you a section to study first.
